    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
            <li>¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
            <li>ect.</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</p></li>
            <li><p>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</p></li>
            <li><p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</p></li>
            <li><p>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</p></li>
            <li><p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p></li>
            <li><p>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</p></li>
            <li><p>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</p></li>
            <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><p>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</p></li>
